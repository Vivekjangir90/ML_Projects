This dataset describes a movie recommendation service.

The data are contained in the files `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` and `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

This is a *development* dataset. As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared research results. See available *benchmark* datasets if that is your intent.



Further Information About GroupLens
===================================

GroupLens is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Since its inception in 1992, GroupLens's research projects have explored a variety of fields including:

* recommender systems
* online communities
* mobile and ubiquitious technologies
* digital libraries
* local geographic information systems

GroupLens Research operates a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering, MovieLens, which is the source of these data. We encourage you to visit <http://movielens.org> to try it out! If you have exciting ideas for experimental work to conduct on MovieLens, send us an email at <grouplens-info@cs.umn.edu> - we are always interested in working with external collaborators.


Content and Use of Files
========================

Formatting and Encoding
-----------------------

The dataset files are written as [comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (`,`) are escaped using double-quotes (`"`). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Misérables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.


User Ids
--------

MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).


Movie Ids
---------

Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id `1` corresponds to the URL <https://movielens.org/movies/1>). Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `links.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).
